# Todo List

Create todos, categorize them and make deadlines

Todos can be created by sending a message to a bot from a messaging service

Workflow:
- remember I need to do something
- send message to bot
- when I have time, sit down and organize all the todos in one go
- todos are scheduled and synchronized with your calendar

Declutter your life!
